# Indeed-UK-Job-Scraper
Web-scrapes jobs of your choice of role and city from Indeed UK

You can download and view the .xlsx files in the repo to see how the generated results look.

To generate your own results follow steps below:
1.  Download the 'Indeed Job Scraper.ipynb' file and open it on jupyer notebook.
2.  Enter your desired job role, location in UK, radius from location by updating the variables in the first code chunk.
3.  Get your free scrapeops api key by creating an account on https://scrapeops.io/ and update the api key variable with the same.
4.  Run entire file, it can take a couple minutes (takes 10-20 min for me) depending on your system, internet speed and the number of pages to scrape based on the details you specified above.
5.  Once all code chunks have had a successful run, a clean .xlsx file will be created in the same directory as the .ipynb file. It will be named based on the job role you had selected. Open that file in excel.

Tip: you can apply advance excel operations on any of the columns to sort or filter the job data.

Happy Job Hunting!
